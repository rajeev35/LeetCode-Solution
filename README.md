# LeetCode-Solution

Sure, here's a README file template focused on documenting your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions:

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Questions and Solutions
Welcome to my repository of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions. This repository is designed to help with coding interview preparation and to practice DSA concepts.
Introduction
This repository contains a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions. The problems are categorized based on the type of data structure or algorithm they involve. Each solution is documented with the problem statement, the code, and an explanation of the approach.

Folder Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on the category of the problem:
